# üìë Soil Analysis Report 

## Introduction

This soil analysis was carried out in June 2025 on a 60 m¬≤ vegetable plot located in a bocage area of mid-mountain in the southeastern Massif Central (Haute-Loire, 1060 m). The site, set on a volcanic substrate (basalts, phonolites) and subject to a humid climate with C√©vennes influence, has a soil rich in swelling clays, well-structured and regularly amended with cow manure. The purpose of this survey is to accurately characterize the texture, specific surface area, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and physico-chemical parameters, to optimize farming practices and to document a reference case for AI and agroecological modeling purposes.

## Context

Parent rock and substrate: granite and basalt with an environment of volcanic domes (phonolite and basalt columns).
Climate: degraded Mediterranean mid-mountain climate with C√©vennes storm events in autumn, alternating wet and dry periods.

Immediate proximity to volcanic slopes with moderate elevation, supporting mainly Abies alba (silver fir) forest, with Fagus sylvatica (beech) and Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) on the edges.
The soils of the coniferous forest upslope are acidic (typically pH water 5.5, KCl 4.0), and a core sample showed an orange eluviated E horizon with sandy texture.

The garden soil, in a meadow/bocage environment, was analyzed on a plot of about 60 m¬≤, regularly fertilized with cow manure. The goal is to deepen the understanding of the site and optimize its use.

The plot is on a slight slope near the forest edge (about 100 m) and receives runoff from the nearby higher ground.

## Analysis Methodology

### General aspect

Ochre-colored soil (#4e3300 to #82612d), suggesting organic matter and oxidized iron, enriched by translocation.

### Particle size

Small stones were separated by sieving; the respective volumes of fine earth and stones were measured:
- Fine soil in a graduated container.
- Stones by measuring water level before and after immersion.

A texture assessment was first done with a Lamotte field test kit (ref 0760).
This method disperses colloids with a chemical agent (1 mL of 20% NaOH), manual stirring, then initial settling for 30 seconds.
Water is then transferred to the next tube and left for 30 minutes (silt settles).
Finally, remaining water containing clays is poured into a third tube.
Clays are flocculated by adding 1 g of CaCl‚ÇÇ (calcium chloride), then left to rest for 8 to 24 hours.

Resulting distribution:
- Sand: 16%
- Coarse silt: 25%
- Fine silt: 25%
- Clay: 34%

Fine soil occupies 91% of the sample volume, stones (>2 mm, avg. 5 mm) 9%.

### Particle size discussion

High swelling observed during tests suggests actual clay content closer to 35‚Äì40%, mainly swelling clays (smectites).
A clear break in sediment appearance above sand indicates rapid deposition of coarse silt just after sand (see `coarse_sand_1.`), pointing to exogenous silt input.
Strong orange (rust) coloration appears in part of each tube, typical of ferric iron (Fe¬≥‚Å∫), found in well-drained soils with variable moisture. After flocculation, this orange zone disappears, confirming its colloidal nature.

### Structural stability

Some rounded aggregates (cm-sized) were recovered and immersed in demineralized water.
No disaggregation occurred for several hours or the next day.
This indicates good structural stability, good erosion resistance and low crusting risk.

### Physico-chemical tests

Hydrogen peroxide test showed strong foaming ‚Äî proof of significant organic matter.
Acid test (20% vinegar) showed no fizzing or crackling: no carbonates.
A 1:1 dilution in demineralized water, stirred for one minute, then reverse-filtered, was done.
Dip test showed nitrates at 250‚Äì300 ppm (high), but no nitrites ‚Äî indicating good aeration despite high nitrate. However, risk of nitrate leaching to the nearby stream should be monitored.
Hardness of 250 ppm (Ca + Mg) measured ‚Äî likely from manure amendments.

**Soil nutrient test results (Lamotte STH-14 Kit):**

- Potassium: estimated between 400‚Äì800 lb/acre (~200‚Äì400 ppm).  
_The standard tube scale reaches 400 lb/acre. By using only half the reagent, the black reference line became visible again, indicating that the true potassium level is above the maximum scale but not fully double._

- Phosphorus: ~100 lb/acre (~50 ppm)

**Interpretation:**  
The soil shows very high exchangeable potassium and sufficient to high phosphorus, fully coherent with regular manure and compost inputs and the presence of high CEC smectitic clays. No immediate need for additional K fertilization; monitor P inputs to prevent excess runoff and eutrophication risk.


Clay specific surface area was determined using the methylene blue spot test (AFNOR X31-107 and AFES recommendation):
- Prepare sieved, dried sample.
- Mix 10 g in 100 mL demineralized water.
- Prepare methylene blue solution: 2 g in 100 mL demineralized water.
- Stir sample with magnetic stirrer.
- Add increments of 1 mL using burette.
- Take a drop with glass rod after each increment, spot on filter paper.

12‚Äì15 mL needed to saturate clays ‚Üí estimated specific surface area: 800‚Äì1000 m¬≤ for 10 g of soil ‚Üí typical for high-swelling clays (smectites).

### pH measurement (AFNOR NF X31-103)

**pH water:**
- 10 g soil in 100 mL demineralized water (specific dilution for heavy clay soil)
- Stir 30 min, rest 20 min, re-stir 20‚Äì30 s
- Calibrate pH meter at 7.01
- Insert probe, read after stabilization

**pH KCl:**
- Add 1 g KCl to same mix
- Stir 5 min, rest, measure again

Result: pH water 6.5, pH KCl 5.8 ‚Üí ŒîpH 0.7 (normal range 0.5‚Äì1.0)
This indicates moderate exchangeable acidity, typical of an active clay-humic complex saturated with bases due to manure. Combined data (texture, specific surface, GH, pH) imply high to very high CEC and optimal fertility for a mountain meadow-bocage soil.

**CEC estimate:** Based on texture (35% swelling clay), measured surface (~80‚Äì100 m¬≤/g), ŒîpH (0.7) and organic enrichment, the inferred CEC is 40‚Äì50 meq/100g ‚Üí high to very high fertility.

## üß≤ Magnetic Fraction ‚Äî Observation and Interpretation

During routine rinsing of the beaker after soil texture and pH tests, small black particles were observed to adhere strongly to the magnetic stir bar, unlike the reddish iron colloids that remained unaffected by a handheld magnet. To investigate, a simple field protocol was implemented: the soil was dry-sieved through a fine mesh (<1‚ÄØmm) directly over a white sheet of paper. A strong magnet was then passed beneath the paper, which revealed clear magnetic patterns and trails, proving that a portion of the fine fraction is responsive to a magnetic field.

To confirm this behavior at a finer scale, the magnetically responsive grains were collected by successive passes, lightly moistened with a drop of water, and transferred drop by drop onto a microscope slide. Under a microscope (40√ó magnification) and direct incident light, these grains were examined while a magnet was moved nearby. The particles aligned into straight chains, behaving like tiny compass needles, and displayed a black color with mostly rounded or slightly irregular shapes. Even after removing the external magnet, they remained attached to each other, forming stable magnetic clusters within the water drop.

This experiment demonstrates that the soil contains a significant fraction of ferromagnetic grains (magnetite Fe‚ÇÉO‚ÇÑ), most likely native volcanic magnetite derived from the local basaltic bedrock, with a possible minor contribution from historical tool abrasion. This fraction can influence soil physical properties and provides a direct minero-pedological fingerprint of the site's volcanic heritage.
This strongly supports the hypothesis that the basalt not only provides the magnetic fraction but also supplies iron, magnesium and silica for the secondary formation of smectite clays, which explains the soil‚Äôs high swelling capacity and elevated CEC.

Following the refined manual separation, two distinct magnetite grain size classes were confirmed using ImageJ:

- **Class 1:** mean ‚âà 69.4 ¬µm, SD ‚âà 18 ¬µm (range: 49.9‚Äì113.2 ¬µm)
- **Class 2:** mean ‚âà 24.8 ¬µm, SD ‚âà 4.9 ¬µm (range: 17.9‚Äì31.6 ¬µm)

This clear bimodal distribution indicates a dominant population of larger primary magnetite grains, directly inherited from the local basaltic bedrock, and a smaller, more homogeneous fraction produced by mechanical breakdown and colluvial transport processes. Together, these measurements support the conclusion that the soil's magnetic behavior originates mainly from natural volcanic magnetite rather than artificial metallic contamination.

The native magnetite grains found in this soil likely formed during Miocene to Pliocene volcanic events (approx. 7 to 2.5 million years ago) when basaltic lava flows cooled below the Curie point, recording the ancient geomagnetic field direction and preserving this signature to this day.

**Note on magnetite micro-aggregates and texture tests:**  

In soils with significant native magnetite grains, these particles can form micro-aggregates at sub-millimeter scale through residual magnetic attraction. Unlike chemical bonds, these physical bonds are unaffected by standard dispersants like NaOH. This hidden cohesion may hinder the full breakdown of the clay-humic complex during Lamotte or hydrometer texture tests, leading to an underestimation of clay fraction. A magnetic pre-treatment or correction may be advisable in magnetite-rich soils.

**Speculative Hypothesis:**

In soils naturally enriched with mobile native magnetite, heavy rainfall or snowmelt events can temporarily resuspend magnetite grains. Once suspended, these particles align with Earth‚Äôs geomagnetic field and self-assemble into micro-scale dipole clusters. This creates subtle, transient magnetic micro-anomalies that can signal the presence of local water accumulation zones (puddles, temporary ponds, seepage pockets).

It is theoretically possible that certain magnetosensitive soil-dwelling species ‚Äî microfauna or small macrofauna ‚Äî could exploit these temporary magnetic gradients to detect and navigate towards moist microhabitats. Over evolutionary timescales, this behavior could confer an ecological advantage under fluctuating climate conditions, favoring survival and reproductive success.

This idea remains a speculative research avenue, bridging soil physics, ethology, and evolutionary ecology.

‚ò¢Ô∏è **Background radiation (Geiger Radex):**

- **Avignon:** ~10 ¬µrem/h (limestone bedrock ‚Äî very low lithophile content).
- **Bocage granitic site:** ~30 ¬µrem/h on open soil; **up to 50 ¬µrem/h** measured in granite crevices and rock cavities (localized micro-enrichment, possible radon traps).
- **Former uranium mine area:** 100‚Äì120 ¬µrem/h at surface near old boreholes or sealed galleries (legacy ore body).

**Instrument:** The Radex Geiger counter detects both beta and gamma rays, giving an integrated reading of naturally occurring isotopes (U, Th, K-40) and possible radon progeny near surface cracks.

‚ò¢Ô∏è **Indoor note:** 

In granite-walled houses typical of the region, radon gas can accumulate if the building is closed for extended periods (especially October to June). This risk is minimized in summer when traditional secondary homes are open and ventilated for holiday occupancy.


### GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

## Risks

- Possible aluminium toxicity if severe erosion exposes acidic granite horizons, but low risk due to dense vegetation cover.
- Possible nitrate pollution of nearby stream (few meters away) and basin due to high nitrate (250‚Äì300 ppm); should be monitored but mitigated by vegetation cover.

## Hypothesis on clay origin

High swelling clay (smectite) content and ferric oxide colloids suggest colluvial translocation from upslope forest, enriching the plot via runoff from the orange eluviated E horizon (acidic pH 5.5).

The abundance of smectites results from double origin: weathering of volcanic bedrock (basalts, phonolites) in a humid mid-mountain climate, plus enrichment by colluvial clay from upslope acidic forest slopes. This synergy explains the swelling properties and high CEC of this meadow-bocage horizon.



## Recommendations

Suitable for root vegetables (carrots, beets), legumes (beans, peas), cabbage, potatoes.
Local fruit trees (chestnut, rustic apple) also suited due to stable structure and high CEC.
