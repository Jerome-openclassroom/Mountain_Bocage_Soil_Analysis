# 📑 Soil Analysis Report 

## Introduction

This soil analysis was carried out in June 2025 on a 60 m² vegetable plot located in a bocage area of mid-mountain in the southeastern Massif Central (Haute-Loire, 1060 m). The site, set on a volcanic substrate (basalts, phonolites) and subject to a humid climate with Cévennes influence, has a soil rich in swelling clays, well-structured and regularly amended with cow manure. The purpose of this survey is to accurately characterize the texture, specific surface area, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and physico-chemical parameters, to optimize farming practices and to document a reference case for AI and agroecological modeling purposes.

## Context

Parent rock and substrate: granite and basalt with an environment of volcanic domes (phonolite and basalt columns).
Climate: degraded Mediterranean mid-mountain climate with Cévennes storm events in autumn, alternating wet and dry periods.

Immediate proximity to volcanic slopes with moderate elevation, supporting mainly Abies alba (silver fir) forest, with Fagus sylvatica (beech) and Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine) on the edges.
The soils of the coniferous forest upslope are acidic (typically pH water 5.5, KCl 4.0), and a core sample showed an orange eluviated E horizon with sandy texture.

The garden soil, in a meadow/bocage environment, was analyzed on a plot of about 60 m², regularly fertilized with cow manure. The goal is to deepen the understanding of the site and optimize its use.

The plot is on a slight slope near the forest edge (about 100 m) and receives runoff from the nearby higher ground.

## Analysis Methodology

### General aspect

Ochre-colored soil (#4e3300 to #82612d), suggesting organic matter and oxidized iron, enriched by translocation.

### Particle size

Small stones were separated by sieving; the respective volumes of fine earth and stones were measured:
- Fine soil in a graduated container.
- Stones by measuring water level before and after immersion.

A texture assessment was first done with a Lamotte field test kit (ref 0760).
This method disperses colloids with a chemical agent (1 mL of 20% NaOH), manual stirring, then initial settling for 30 seconds.
Water is then transferred to the next tube and left for 30 minutes (silt settles).
Finally, remaining water containing clays is poured into a third tube.
Clays are flocculated by adding 1 g of CaCl₂ (calcium chloride), then left to rest for 8 to 24 hours.

Resulting distribution:
- Sand: 16%
- Coarse silt: 25%
- Fine silt: 25%
- Clay: 34%

Fine soil occupies 91% of the sample volume, stones (>2 mm, avg. 5 mm) 9%.

### Particle size discussion

High swelling observed during tests suggests actual clay content closer to 35–40%, mainly swelling clays (smectites).
A clear break in sediment appearance above sand indicates rapid deposition of coarse silt just after sand (see `coarse_sand_1.`), pointing to exogenous silt input.
Strong orange (rust) coloration appears in part of each tube, typical of ferric iron (Fe³⁺), found in well-drained soils with variable moisture. After flocculation, this orange zone disappears, confirming its colloidal nature.

### Structural stability

Some rounded aggregates (cm-sized) were recovered and immersed in demineralized water.
No disaggregation occurred for several hours or the next day.
This indicates good structural stability, good erosion resistance and low crusting risk.

### Physico-chemical tests

Hydrogen peroxide test showed strong foaming — proof of significant organic matter.
Acid test (20% vinegar) showed no fizzing or crackling: no carbonates.
A 1:1 dilution in demineralized water, stirred for one minute, then reverse-filtered, was done.
Dip test showed nitrates at 250–300 ppm (high), but no nitrites — indicating good aeration despite high nitrate. However, risk of nitrate leaching to the nearby stream should be monitored.
Hardness of 250 ppm (Ca + Mg) measured — likely from manure amendments.

Clay specific surface area was determined using the methylene blue spot test (AFNOR X31-107 and AFES recommendation):
- Prepare sieved, dried sample.
- Mix 10 g in 100 mL demineralized water.
- Prepare methylene blue solution: 2 g in 100 mL demineralized water.
- Stir sample with magnetic stirrer.
- Add increments of 1 mL using burette.
- Take a drop with glass rod after each increment, spot on filter paper.

12–15 mL needed to saturate clays → estimated specific surface area: 800–1000 m² for 10 g of soil → typical for high-swelling clays (smectites).

### pH measurement (AFNOR NF X31-103)

**pH water:**
- 10 g soil in 100 mL demineralized water (specific dilution for heavy clay soil)
- Stir 30 min, rest 20 min, re-stir 20–30 s
- Calibrate pH meter at 7.01
- Insert probe, read after stabilization

**pH KCl:**
- Add 1 g KCl to same mix
- Stir 5 min, rest, measure again

Result: pH water 6.5, pH KCl 5.8 → ΔpH 0.7 (normal range 0.5–1.0)
This indicates moderate exchangeable acidity, typical of an active clay-humic complex saturated with bases due to manure. Combined data (texture, specific surface, GH, pH) imply high to very high CEC and optimal fertility for a mountain meadow-bocage soil.

**CEC estimate:** Based on texture (35% swelling clay), measured surface (~80–100 m²/g), ΔpH (0.7) and organic enrichment, the inferred CEC is 40–50 meq/100g → high to very high fertility.

## Risks

- Possible aluminium toxicity if severe erosion exposes acidic granite horizons, but low risk due to dense vegetation cover.
- Possible nitrate pollution of nearby stream (few meters away) and basin due to high nitrate (250–300 ppm); should be monitored but mitigated by vegetation cover.

## Hypothesis on clay origin

High swelling clay (smectite) content and ferric oxide colloids suggest colluvial translocation from upslope forest, enriching the plot via runoff from the orange eluviated E horizon (acidic pH 5.5).

The abundance of smectites results from double origin: weathering of volcanic bedrock (basalts, phonolites) in a humid mid-mountain climate, plus enrichment by colluvial clay from upslope acidic forest slopes. This synergy explains the swelling properties and high CEC of this meadow-bocage horizon.

## Recommendations

Suitable for root vegetables (carrots, beets), legumes (beans, peas), cabbage, potatoes.
Local fruit trees (chestnut, rustic apple) also suited due to stable structure and high CEC.
